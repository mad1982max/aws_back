**QueryParam**

```js
{
  name: string;
}
```

- **Frontend** application is integrated with importProductsFile lambda

- The **importFileParser** lambda function is implemented and **serverless.yml** contains configuration for the lambda - **DONE**

**Additional (optional) tasks** (2 POINTS)

- **+1** async/await is used in lambda functions
- **+1** At the end of the stream the lambda function should move the file from the uploaded folder into the parsed folder (move the file means that file should be copied into parsed folder, and then deleted from uploaded folder)

## Task 4-----------------------------------

**FrontEnd PR**:

- https://github.com/mad1982max/shop-react-redux-cloudfront/pull/3

**BackEnd END POINTS**  
GET - https://ui834rx8q3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/products/{productId}  
GET - https://ui834rx8q3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/products  
POST - https://ui834rx8q3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/products

**Schemas**

}
```

**DONE**

- **Main** ALL

  - Task 4.1 :

    - created a database instance in _RDS_
    - created 2 tables (_products_, _stocks_) with _DBeaver_
    - added _SQL script_: **helpers/db/sql_fillByData.js** and fill tables with data

  - Task 4.2:

    - Extended serverless.yml file with credentials to database instance and passed it to lambdaâ€™s environment
    - Integrated _GET/products_ lambda to return a list of products from the database (joined stocks and products tables). Product instance on FE side is joined model of product and stock by productId.
    - environment variables stored to _.gitignore_
    - Integrated _GET/products/{productId}_ lambda to return a product from the database

  - Task 4.3:

    - Implemented POST/products lambda and implemented its logic (created a new item in a products table)

    - Committed all work to separate branches (e.g. task-4 from master) in BE (backend) and if in FE (frontend) repositories.
    - Created a pull request to the master branch.

- **Additional** 2 from 4

  - All lambdas return error 500 status code on any error (DB connection, any unhandled error in code)
  - All lambdas do console.log for each incoming requests and their arguments

## Task 3-----------------------------------

# 1. Main: _all done_

- **Product-service** and **YAML** added
- **getProductsList and getProductsById** - added and returned correct response
- **Frontend** application is integrated with product service (**https://d1pamqutpae0js.cloudfront.net**)

# 2. Additional:

- Async/await is used in lambda functions
- ES6 modules are used for product-service implementation
- Lambda handlers (getProductsList, getProductsById) code is written not in 1 single module (file) and separated in codebase.
- Main error scenarious are handled by API ("Product not found" error).
