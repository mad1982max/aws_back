## Task 3

# 1. Main: _all done_

- **Product-service** and **YAML** added
- **getProductsList and getProductsById** - added and returned correct response
- **Frontend** application is integrated with product service (**https://d1pamqutpae0js.cloudfront.net**)

# 2. Additional:

- Async/await is used in lambda functions
- ES6 modules are used for product-service implementation
- Lambda handlers (getProductsList, getProductsById) code is written not in 1 single module (file) and separated in codebase.
- Main error scenarious are handled by API ("Product not found" error).
